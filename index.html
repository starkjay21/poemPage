        <p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>
        When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
        <p>When the funds are low but the debts are high,<br>
        And you want to smile but you have to sigh,</p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>

        <p>Life is strange with its twists and turns,<br>
        As every one of us sometimes learns,</p>

        <p>And many failures turn about<br>
        When we might have won had we stuck it out.</p>

        <p>Don’t give up though the pace seems slow –<br>
        You may succeed with another blow.</p>

        <p>Success is failure turned inside out –<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,</p>

    <div class="container3">
        <p>You can never tell how close you are,<br>
        It may be near when it seems so far;</p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit – <br>
             It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit.</p>
